### Hi all ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a front-end engineer currently working on [AntV](https://antv.antgroup.com/).
- ðŸŽ¨ I'm interested in rendering technology:
  - [@antv/g](https://github.com/antvis/g) - A flexible rendering engine for visualization adapting all underlying rendering APIs (Canvas2D / SVG / WebGL / WebGPU / CanvasKit / Node.js) on the web side. It supports for upper tier products such as [G2](https://github.com/antvis/g2), [G6](https://github.com/antvis/g6) and [L7](https://github.com/antvis/l7).
  - [@antv/g-device-api](https://github.com/antvis/g-device-api) - A hardware adaptation layer using WebGL & WebGPU underneath.
  - [@antv/layout-gpu](https://github.com/antvis/layout/tree/v5/packages/layout-gpu) - Speed up graph algorithm with GPGPU(WebGL & WebGPU underneath) [How I made it](https://www.yuque.com/antv/ou292n/iumyla)
  - [renderer](https://github.com/xiaoiver/renderer) - A toy renderer inspired by [bevy](https://bevyengine.org). Based on ECS architectural pattern and WebGPU.
- ðŸ¦€ I've also been learning Rust lately:
  - [@antv/layout-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antv/layout-wasm) - A WASM binding of `@antv/layout-rust` using Rust implementing some graph layout algorithm like Force. We also used wasm-bindgen-rayon to implement data parallelism with WebWorkers. [How I made it](https://www.yuque.com/antv/ou292n/liecizqp9wkim3g6)
  - Use [naga](https://github.com/antvis/G/blob/next/rust/Cargo.toml) and its WASM binding for transpiling GLSL to WGSL.
- ðŸŒ± Other web techniques like WebCodecs, WebAudioAPI and WebNN:
  - [player](https://github.com/xiaoiver/player) - A soccer video analyzer inspired by [Tracking Football Players with YOLOv5 + ByteTrack](https://medium.com/@amritangshu.mukherjee/tracking-football-players-with-yolov5-bytetrack-efa317c9aaa4) using some web techniques like WebCodecs / WebAudioAPI / WebGPU.
