### Hi all ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a front-end engineer currently working on [AntV](https://antv.antgroup.com/).
- ðŸŒ± Here's some interesting projects:
  - [@antv/g](https://github.com/antvis/g) - A flexible rendering engine for visualization.
  - [@antv/g-device-api](https://github.com/antvis/g-device-api) - A hardware adaptation layer using WebGL & WebGPU underneath.
  - [@antv/layout-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antv/layout-wasm) - A WASM binding of `@antv/layout-rust` using Rust implementing some graph layout algorithm like Force. We also used wasm-bindgen-rayon to implement data parallelism with WebWorkers.
  - [player](https://github.com/xiaoiver/player) - A soccer video analyzer inspired by [Tracking Football Players with YOLOv5 + ByteTrack](https://medium.com/@amritangshu.mukherjee/tracking-football-players-with-yolov5-bytetrack-efa317c9aaa4) using some web techniques like WebCodecs / WebAudioAPI / WebGPU.
